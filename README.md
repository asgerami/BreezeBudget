# BreezeBudget

A React app to calculate AC costs. Built this to help figure out if upgrading my AC unit was worth it.

## What it does

- Gets weather data for your ZIP code
- Calculates cooling costs based on your home details
- Compares different AC units
- Shows you charts and stuff
- Lets you download a PDF report

## Tech stuff

- React + TypeScript
- Vite for building
- Tailwind CSS for styling
- Chart.js for graphs
- Some weather APIs

## Getting started

1. Clone this repo
2. Run `npm install`
3. Run `npm run dev`
4. Open http://localhost:5173

## TODO

- [ ] Add user accounts
- [ ] Save calculation history
- [ ] Mobile app version
- [ ] Better error handling (sometimes the weather API is slow)

## Notes

The weather data comes from Open-Meteo API. Sometimes it's a bit slow but it's free so ¯\_(ツ)\_/¯

Built this in 2024. Still learning React so code might be messy in places.
